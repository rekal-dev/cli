# Git Transportation Layer

## Problem

Rekal captures AI coding sessions and stores them in a local DuckDB database. To share session data across machines and team members, this data needs to live in git — specifically on a local orphan branch (`rekal/<email>`) that doesn't pollute the working tree.

The naive approach — committing the raw DuckDB file — fails for several reasons:

1. **DuckDB files are opaque binaries.** Git can't delta-compress them effectively. A 50MB database that gains 1KB of data produces a 50MB delta.
2. **No incremental append.** Every checkpoint replaces the entire blob.
3. **Merging is impossible.** Two developers can't merge DuckDB files.

## Solution: Append-Only Binary Wire Format

Two files on the orphan branch:

```
rekal.body    Append-only sequence of compressed frames.
dict.bin      Append-only string dictionary.
```

### Why two files, not one?

`dict.bin` is a separate file because it needs random-access lookup during decode — a frame payload contains varint indices into the dictionary, not raw strings. Keeping the dictionary separate means a reader can load it once and decode any frame. It also keeps `rekal.body` strictly append-only (the dictionary grows but its existing entries never change).

### Why not TSV/JSON?

We considered TSV files for checkpoint metadata and file-touched records (human-readable, easy to debug). We rejected this because:

- It adds serialization complexity for marginal debuggability gain.
- The DuckDB database already serves as the human-readable query interface (`rekal query`).
- Binary frames with a consistent envelope are simpler to implement and maintain.
- Fewer files means fewer git objects per checkpoint.

## Format Details

### rekal.body

```
Header (9 bytes):
  "RKLBODY" (7 bytes magic)
  version   (u8, currently 0x01)
  flags     (u8, bit 0 = preset zstd dictionary available)

Frame sequence (repeated):
  Envelope (6 bytes, uncompressed):
    type            (u8: 0x01=session, 0x02=checkpoint, 0x03=meta)
    compressed_len  (u24 little-endian)
    uncompressed_len (u16 little-endian)
  Payload (compressed_len bytes, zstd-compressed)
```

The 6-byte envelope is always uncompressed. This allows scanning all frame offsets without decompressing any payload — useful for seeking to a specific frame or counting frames.

### dict.bin

Four namespaces, each append-only:

| Namespace | Entry format | Typical values |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Sessions  | Fixed 26-byte ULID | `01KJ9KSM...` |
| Branches  | 1-byte length + UTF-8 | `main`, `feature/auth` |
| Emails    | 1-byte length + UTF-8 | `dev@example.com` |
| Paths     | 2-byte length (u16 LE) + UTF-8 | `src/auth/handler.go` |

Frame payloads reference strings by namespace + varint index. For index < 128, this costs 1 byte instead of the full string.

### Frame types

**Session (0x01):** One captured AI session — turns (role + text + timestamp delta) and tool calls (tool code + path ref + command prefix).

**Checkpoint (0x02):** Git state at capture time — HEAD SHA, branch, files changed (path ref + change type A/M/D/R), and references to the session frames included in this checkpoint.

**Meta (0x03):** Summary counters — total sessions, checkpoints, frames, dictionary entries. Written last in each checkpoint batch.

## Why This Works With Git

### Append-only = good deltas

`rekal.body` only grows. Existing bytes never change. When git computes the delta between two versions of `rekal.body`, it sees the old content as a prefix of the new content. The delta is just the appended bytes.

Verified empirically: after a second checkpoint that added 291 bytes, the SHA-256 of the body prefix (first N bytes) was identical to the previous version.

### Zstd with preset dictionary

Each frame payload is independently zstd-compressed using a 16KB preset dictionary embedded in the binary. The dictionary is trained on patterns common in AI coding sessions:

- Assistant phrases ("Let me read the file", "I've updated the")
- Tool names and paths (Read, Edit, Bash, `src/`, `.go`, `.ts`)
- Programming keywords and structures

This achieves ~2:1 compression on typical session frames. Independent compression per frame means any frame can be decoded without context from other frames.

### Dictionary never rewrites

`dict.bin` entries are only appended. Existing indices are stable. A session captured today that references path index 42 will always find the same string at index 42. This means `dict.bin` also benefits from git delta compression.

## Data Flow

```
Claude Code session (.jsonl)
  → rekal checkpoint
    → Parse transcript (session/parse.go)
    → Dedup by SHA-256 hash
    → Insert into DuckDB (local queryable copy)
    → Encode session frame (codec package)
    → Encode checkpoint frame with git state
    → Encode meta frame with counters
    → Append frames to rekal.body
    → Update dict.bin
    → Commit both files to orphan branch
```

The DuckDB database and the wire format contain the same data. DuckDB is the query interface; the wire format is the transport/sync mechanism.

## Trade-offs

| Decision | Chose | Alternative | Reason |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| All binary vs TSV+binary | All binary | TSV for metadata | Simpler, fewer files, DuckDB handles querying |
| 1 body file vs N shards | 1 file | Shard by date/size | Simpler, git handles large files fine, append-only gives good deltas |
| Preset zstd dict | Yes, 16KB | No dictionary | ~2x better compression for small payloads at negligible binary size cost |
| String dictionary | Separate file | Inline in frames | Enables varint refs (1 byte vs full string), random-access lookup |
| Frame envelope uncompressed | Yes | Compress everything | Enables frame scanning without decompression |
